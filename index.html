<h2> <big> The history of Artificial Intelligence </big> began in antiquity, with myths, stories and rumors of 
      artificial beings endowed with intelligence or consciousness by master craftsmen.The seeds of modern AI 
      who attempted to describe the process of human thinking as the mechanical manipulation of symbols.This
      work culminated in were planted by classical philosophers programmable digital computer in the 1940s,
      a machine based on the abstract essence of mathematical reasoning. This device and  the invention of 
      the the ideas behind it inspired a handful of scientists to begin seriously discussing the possibility of
      building an electronic brain.

      The field of AI research was founded at a workshop held on the campus of Dartmouth College during the
      summer of 1956. Those who attended would become the leaders of AI research for decades. Many of them 
      predicted that a machine as  intelligent as a human being would exist in no more than a generation,
      and they were given millions of dollars  to make this vision come true.

      Eventually, it became obvious that they had grossly underestimated the difficulty of the project. In 1973,
      in response  to the criticism  from James Lighthill and ongoing pressure from congress, the U.S.and British
      Governments stopped funding  undirected research into  artificial intelligence, and the difficult years that
      followed would later be known as an "AI winter". Seven years later, a visionary initiative  by the Japanese 
      Government inspired governments and industry to provide AI with billions  of dollars, but by the late 80s 
      the investors became disillusioned and withdrew funding again. 
 
      Investment and interest in AI boomed in the first decades of the 21st century when machine learning was 
      successfully applied to many problems in academia and industry due to new methods, the application of 
      powerful computer hardware, and the collection of  immense data sets.
